I went with a bootstrap card layout, with two sentences and an image for each module.  Clicking on the card will bring to a more descriptive page with a featurelist and more screenshots.</p>\n<p>I use Jekyll's header system to define a few variables for each post: the showcase image, a DOI, the github URL, and a URL of the module in action on our live site.  These headers get converted into icons and links on the landing page, and on each module's individual page.</p>\n<p>The below markdown file (located in <code class=\"language-text\">_posts/</code>) describes a single module: Tripal Alchemist.  </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"md\"><pre class=\"language-md\"><code class=\"language-md\">---\nlayout: post\ntitle:  &quot;Tripal Alchemist&quot;\nimg: alchemist_card.png\ngithub: https://github.com/statonlab/tripal_alchemist\nzenodo_badge: https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.1187120.svg\nzenodo_url: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1187120\nsee_live: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPL6zmVx_RM\n---\n\nConvert Tripal Entities from one bundle to another.\n\n* Convert Tripal Entities from one bundle to another.\n* Used at HWG to change feature types, or to convert analyses to sub-types with specialized fields.\n* Supports **collections** to easily convert entities.\n\nWatch a video of the [module in action on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPL6zmVx_RM)!\n\n&gt;![manual conversion](../images/alchemist/manual_transmutation.png)\n&gt; For small bundles, manually select entities to convert.\n\n&gt;![collections support](../images/alchemist/tripal_alchemist_collections.png)\n&gt;Use collections to easily convert a subset of entities.</code></pre></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/statonlab/hardwoods_tripal_showcase\">The code is up on Github</a> so feel free to adapt it to your own needs.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Module showcase"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2018-06-08-module_showcase_site/"}}
