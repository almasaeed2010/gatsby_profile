We can accomplish this by <strong>nesting</strong> our data according to the property we would like to group by.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">var data = [{name: \"one\", property: \"a\", value: 100},\n             {name: \"two\", property: \"a\", value: 50},\n             {name: \"two\", property: \"b\", value: 20},\n             {name: \"four\", property: \"b\", value: 57},\n             {name: \"five\", property: \"b\", value: 17},\n             {name: \"six\", property: \"a\", value: 5},\n             {name: \"seven\", property: \"a\", value: 52},\n             {name: \"eight\", property: \"a\", value: 11},\n             {name: \"nine\", property: \"b\", value: 81},\n             {name: \"ten\", property: \"b\", value: 62},     \n              ];\n</code></pre>\n<p>What does our nested output look like?  We can <code>console.log</code> the nested data to take a look.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">[  { \"key\": \"a\",\n     \"values\": [\n      { \"name\": \"one\",\n        \"property\": \"a\",\n        \"value\": 100\n      },\n    //...\n    // additional values removed for readability      \n      ]\n\n  },\n  { \"key\": \"b\",\n    \"values\": [\n      { \"name\": \"three\",\n        \"property\": \"b\",\n        \"value\": 20\n      },\n      { \"name\": \"four\",\n        \"property\": \"b\",\n        \"value\": 57\n      },\n      //...\n      // additional values removed for readability\n     ]\n  }]\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see, we now have an array of objects, where each object has two keys: a <code>key</code> that corresponds to the property name we nested by, and a <code>values</code> that holds an array of all the data matching that property.</p>\n<p>Now that our data is nested, how do we place it appropriately on our graph?  This is where <strong>Ordinal Scale Bands</strong> comes in.  Each property group will correspond to a single band, with individual samples distributed within it. </p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">var xScale = d3.scale.ordinal()\n  xScale.domain(data.map(function (entry) {\n    return entry.key\n  }))\n    .rangeRoundBands([0, width], padding, outerPadding)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Our X-scale has two locations now: one for each of our two properties (\"a\" or \"b\").  Our next scale needs to map to <strong>within one of these domains</strong> based on the <strong>sample name</strong>.  Most of the examples I could find online use a uniform set of samples within each band: (<a href=\"https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3887051\">see here for an example</a>).  For some data this will be the case: each property group is made of male/female, or the same set of time points.  In our case, we don't know that the each sample won't appear in each group.  In fact, we don't even know if we have even property groups.  How can we deal with this?</p>\n<p>The solution I came up with is to build a scale index.  Each property group gets its <strong>own scale</strong> in addition to the main scale.  </p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">  x2Scales = {}//create a scale tracker\n\n  //go through the data and generated an individual scale for each group.\n  data.map(function (propertyGroup) {\n    entriesInProperty = []\n    key               = propertyGroup.key\n    propertyGroup.values.map(function (entry) {\n      entriesInProperty.push(entry.name)\n    })\n    newScale      = d3.scale.ordinal()\n      .domain(entriesInProperty)\n      .rangeRoundPoints([0, xScale.rangeBand()])\n    x2Scales[key] = newScale\n  })\n</code></pre>\n<p>  Now our <code>x2Scales</code> object holds all the scales we need, index by the property group name.</p>\n<h3>Inputing nested data</h3>\n<p>Something you may find confusing is how to access our nested data.  We input our nested data the same way we do our unnested data: using the <code>selectAll('.newGroupClass').data(data).enter().append()</code> chain.  </p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">  var barGroups = svg.selectAll('.barGroup')\n    .data(data)\n    .enter()\n    .append('g')\n    .attr('transform', function (d) {\n      return 'translate(' + xScale(d.key) + ',0)'\n    })  \n</code></pre>\n<p>Where before the <code>d</code> object was the individual entry, now it's actually an object with a <code>key</code> and <code>values</code> index, with the entries we want to loop through under <code>values</code>.  How do we access them?  By performing <strong>another</strong> <code>selectAll().data().enter().append()</code> chain!  Rather than passing in a data object into the <code>.data()</code> call, we pass in a function that retrieves the entry!</p>\n<p>Once the data is entered, it's a matter of styling each bar in the bargroup: setting the height and fill, as before, but also transforming the x-value <strong>again</strong> to compensate for its locatio</p>\n<p>Notice that we use the <code>barGroups</code> variable we defined earlier, and then append <code>.bar</code> elements.\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">var bars = barGroups.selectAll('.bar')\n      .data(function (d) {\n        return d.values\n      }).enter()\n    .append('rect')\n    .style('fill', function (d) {\n      return colorScale(d.property)\n    })\n      .attr('transform', function(d){\n        var scale = x2Scales[d.property]//fetch the scale\n        //shift this bar by its location in the scale\n        return 'translate(' +  scale(d.name) + ',0)'\n      })\n    .attr('y', function (d) {\n        return yScale(d.value)\n      }\n    )\n    .style('height', function (d, i) {\n      return height - yScale(d.value)\n    })\n    .attr('width', 10)\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<div id=\"plot_three\"></div>\nOur plot now separates samples into groups.\n</blockquote>\n<p>An interesting challenge is dealing with uneven groups.  With this approach, every group has the same bandwidth, and the spacing within groups are calculated for each one individually.  This can be result in tightly packed groups and dispersed groups in the same plot.  We can adjust the padding for each group based on the number of samples, but we're still left with unused space in our plot for smaller groups.  </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"D3 part three: Nesting"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2018-01-17-d3_part3_nesting/"}}
